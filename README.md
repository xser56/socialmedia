## Major Issues

1. **Fonts**
   - The fonts are not displayed correctly.

2. **White Bar in the Middle**
   - There is a large white bar in the middle of the screen that isn't part of the main container.

3. **Container Size**
   - The main container does not appear as expected and seems to take up the entire screen.
   - **Recommendation:** The container should occupy approximately **80%** of the screen width.

4. **Responsiveness**
   - The responsiveness does not function properly.

5. **Hover Effects**
   - The hover effects are too dark and could use some adjustment on light overview.
